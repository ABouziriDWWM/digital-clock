# Digital Clock
This is a simple digital clock web page that displays the current time in 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The time updates every second.

## Features
Displays hours, minutes, and seconds in large font.

Uses a semi-transparent background with a blur effect to make the clock readable over the background image.

Background image covers the whole page and stays fixed when scrolling.

Responsive design that centers the clock both horizontally and vertically.

## How it works
The clock is implemented using JavaScript to fetch the current time from the system.

The time is converted from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator.

The display updates every second using setInterval.

## How to use
Open the HTML file in a web browser.

The digital clock will appear centered on the screen with the background image.

The time updates automatically â€” no need for manual refresh.

## Files
index.html â€” contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the clock.

## Customization
âœ… You can:

Change the background image URL in the CSS background-image property.
